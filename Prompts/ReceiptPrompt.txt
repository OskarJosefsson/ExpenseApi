This is supposed to be a receipt. Please analyze the text below and return all items in a JSON structure with the following fields:
- each item's 'name' and 'cost'
- total 'cost'
- the 'shop name' (if available)
- a 'category' for each item (such as Snacks, Beverages, Dairy, etc.)
- a 'general category' for the whole receipt (like Food, Electronics, Household, etc.)

The JSON should be formatted like this, and must be able to be deserialized into the following C# class structure:

public class ChatGptReceipt
{
    public List<Item> Items { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalCost { get; set; }
    public string ShopName { get; set; }
    public string ReceiptCategory { get; set; }
}

public class Item
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Cost { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
}

Receipt text:
{imageText}

Please ensure the output is **well-formed JSON** and contains **no extra text**. Only the JSON response should be returned.
